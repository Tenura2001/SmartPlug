## IoT Integration
The Smart Power Monitor utilizes **Node-RED** for IoT data processing, visualization, and user interaction. Node-RED is a powerful, open-source, flow-based development tool ideal for building IoT applications with minimal coding.

### Why Node-RED?

- **Visual Flow Editor:** Easily create workflows by connecting nodes graphically.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly develop dashboards and integrate protocols like MQTT.
- **Extensible:** Supports a wide variety of nodes including MQTT, HTTP, database, and dashboard widgets.
- **Lightweight & Portable:** Runs on multiple platforms such as Raspberry Pi, servers, or cloud.

### Integration Architecture

1. **Data Acquisition:**  
   The custom ESP32 firmware reads power consumption from sensors on the PCB and publishes the data via **MQTT** protocol to an MQTT broker.

2. **Data Reception & Processing:**  
   Node-RED subscribes to MQTT topics to receive the real-time sensor data. Using function nodes, it processes, filters, or analyzes the data as needed.

3. **Visualization:**  
   Data is displayed on a **Node-RED Dashboard** using gauges, charts, and text elements, enabling intuitive real-time monitoring of power consumption.

4. **Alerts & Automation:**  
   Node-RED flows can be extended to trigger alerts or perform automated actions based on thresholds or specific conditions.
