##  Introduction

This project demonstrates the **complete product development cycle** for an IoT consumer product — from **conceptualization** to **final working prototype**.  
The **Smart Power Monitor** measures power usage, sends data to a dashboard, and provides a **real-time IoT interface** using Node-RED and MQTT.

It was developed as part of a comprehensive hands-on training program covering:
- Product development cycle & prototyping
- PCB design with KiCAD & fabrication
- Firmware development for ESP32 (PlatformIO & Wokwi)
- IoT dashboard creation using Node-RED and MQTT
- 3D CAD enclosure design using OnShape
- Final assembly & soldering

---

##  Features
- **Custom PCB** with optimized schematic & layout
- **ESP32 firmware** for real-time data acquisition
- **IoT-enabled dashboard** with Node-RED & MQTT
- **3D-printed enclosure** with UK-standard plug
- Support for **through-hole & SMT soldering**
- **Portable & compact** for consumer use
